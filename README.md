### SMOOTH ROD :
It is guide rail component made up of hardened-steel or chrome plated steel .it smoothness ensures precise and consistent movement which is needed to produce accurate and high quality models

 #### BEARING :
Linear bearings are typically used in conjunction with smooth rods,they are used to reduce friction . linear motion and rotational motion-ball bearing

 #### IDLER :
The idler pulley helps to guide the belt along its path, reducing the chances of the belt slipping or jumping teeth and causing print defects.

#### EXTRUDER :
Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed

#### MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

#### Y AXIS ASSEMBLY

 #### Y AXIS SUPPORTER
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability.

 #### Horiz. & Vertical Threaded Rod :
The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed

#### SMOOTH ROD :
The use of smooth rods in the printer's Y-axis mechanism helps to provide smooth and precise movement of the print bed

#### PULLEY :
pulley is often used in the Y-axis mechanism to transfer motion from the printer's stepper motor to the print bed.

#### MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes

#### Y AXIS FRAME :
It is responsible for support and stability of y axis frame.and also z axis.

#### Y AXIS BASE :
The Y-axis base is responsible for providing stability and support to the entire printer's structure, including the Y-axis frame, the print bed, and the printed object


##### Z AXIS ASSEMBLY

#### Z AXIS ROD :
The z-axis rod is responsible for supporting the weight of the print head and controlling its movement as it moves up and down during the printing process

#### Z AXIS TOP COVER :
The primary purpose of the z-axis top cover is to prevent dust and debris from settling on the z-axis rod, which can cause damage to the rod and the bearings that guide it

#### MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

#### FRAME :
rigid structure that holds all the other components of the printer.

#### Y AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Y-axis is responsible for moving the print bed back and forth along the horizontal axis.

#### Z AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Z-axis is responsible for moving the print head up and down along the vertical axis.

#### X AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The X-axis is responsible for moving the print head back and forth along the horizontal axis.

#### SMPS :
convert ac to dc current.

#### LCD :
LCD screen provides a user-friendly interface that allows the user to control the printer and monitor its progress during printing.

#### SPOOL HOLDER :
It holds spool.

#### SPOOL :
A spool refers to a roll of filament that is used as the printing material for the 3D printer.
